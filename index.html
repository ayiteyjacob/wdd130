                 <p>Kwame Nkrumah, Ghanaâ€™s first president as an independent nation, was born in 1909. His birthplace is Nkroful in the western region of South Ghana. According to Public Broadcasting Services (PBS) records, Nkrumah came from a humble and traditional Ghanaian family. He received his early education from Catholic missionaries and, at the age of 17, became an untrained teacher and taught at the town of Half Assini. In 1926, he joined Achimota Teachers College in Accra, and earned a teaching certificate in 1930. Nkrumah taught at several Catholic elementary schools in Ghana following his attainment of this education. He carried on teaching in his homeland until 1935, when he sailed to study at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania.</p>
